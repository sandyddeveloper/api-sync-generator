# ⚡ 2-Minute Quickstart

If you want to integrate the backend APIs immediately, follow these simple steps. This has been generated dynamically based on the available API schemas.

### 1. Locate the Generated Code
Your API client, React Hooks, and TypeScript Types have been generated in this directory (`./api`).

### 2. Configure the API URL
Ensure your frontend project (`.env.local`) has the environment variable pointing to the backend, e.g.:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
# or VITE_API_URL if using Vite
```

### 3. Immediately Use a Hook
You don't need to write manual fetchers or `useState` hooks. Simply pick any generated hook.

**Example Integration:**
{% set first_endpoint = endpoints[0] if endpoints else none %}
{% if first_endpoint %}
{% set hook_name = 'use' ~ first_endpoint.operation_id[0]|upper ~ first_endpoint.operation_id[1:] %}
```tsx
import { {{ hook_name }} } from '@/api/hooks';

export function QuickIntegration() {
  const { execute, data, error, isLoading } = {{ hook_name }}();

  // Call `execute({...})` on click or in a useEffect!
}
```
{% else %}
*No endpoints found to generate an example.*
{% endif %}
